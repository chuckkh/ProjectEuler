# ProjectEuler

These are my solutions to some of the famous Project Euler challenges.

I have mostly been using Python, but I want to include C++ as well, which is actually my preferred language for projects. Python just seems well-suited to these easier problems because you can push through them quickly.

I intend to complete 1-50. I have not taken them quite in order, but I will complete them. I've also checked out a few higher difficulty questions, and managed to solve 102, which is 15%.

I created a Python module PEtools.py which needs to be imported for some of them.

I have not used any external resources or checked any suggested methods for any of these. I haven't needed to so far. I prefer to force myself through every step.

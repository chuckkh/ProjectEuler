# ProjectEuler 1-50, etc.

These are my solutions to some of the famous Project Euler challenges.

So far, the highest difficulty level I've solved has been 40%, which was Problem 90. I also solved Problem 86, which has 35% difficulty.

I intended to use C++ more than I did. I did #1 in C++, but also in Python, and I've done all the rest in Python. C++ is actually my my preferred language for projects, but Python just seems well-suited to these easier problems because you can push through them quickly.

I've completed 1-50, and I'm working on 51-100.

I created a Python module PEtools.py which needs to be imported for some of them. The import is in the code when necessary, but it will only work if PEtools.py is in the same folder.

I have not used any external resources or checked any suggested methods for any of these. I haven't needed to so far. I prefer to force myself through every step.

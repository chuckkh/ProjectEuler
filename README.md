# ProjectEuler 1-50

These are my solutions to some of the famous Project Euler challenges.

I intended to use C++ more than I did. I did #1 in C++, but also in Python, and I've done all the rest in Python. C++ is actually my my preferred language for projects, but Python just seems well-suited to these easier problems because you can push through them quickly.

I've completed 1-50, and I also knocked off a few of the higher ones
#67 difficulty 5%
#87 difficulty 20%
#102 difficulty 15%
#104 difficulty 25%

I created a Python module PEtools.py which needs to be imported for some of them. The import is in the code when necessary, but it will only work if PEtools.py is in the same folder.

I have not used any external resources or checked any suggested methods for any of these. I haven't needed to so far. I prefer to force myself through every step.
I did some research on Euclid's Orchard, coprimes and common factors while attempting #351, but I only came across ideas I had already tried! That is, I worked at it myself, checking many possibilities, and when I finally tried searching for hints, I found nothing I hadn't already tried. There just don't seem to be any shortcuts. I see that some people have published actual solutions to it, but I haven't looked.
